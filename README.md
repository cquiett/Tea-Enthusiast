THE TEA ENTHUSIAST
The Tea Enthusiast is an App for tea lovers who want to search for books about tea. Search terms such as "tea history" and "tea party" can be entered in the "Enter tea search here window".  Press "Get tea info" to retrieve a result.

The result will return and display up to 5 books related to your search topic. If the book is available for purchase, the Retail Price will appear. The user can then select "Buy Link" to purchase the book. Google Books is the search engine for this app.

The developer for this app has also provided her personal blog link.

I used the Carousel UI to display pictures of someone having afternoon tea.
I used AJAX to access the Google Books API. I used the coding from class to help me with the picture Carousel and AJAX. I also added my own coding to display my skills for using Flexbox in CSS and to demonstrate my linking skills by linking My Blog webpage, which was designed for being accepted into this class.

I plan to update this app by putting my instructions into a Modal, redesigning My Blog on my personal gitHub rather than General Assembly's. Additionally, I plan to include links for my favorite tea distributors and my favorite afternoon tearooms located in my local metropolitan area.
